A curated list of resources about the emerging renaissance of psychedelics drugs and their potential benefits.

## Intro 

Today, in the midst of the age of inovation, liberality, and new ideas, transaprent education about (hard) drugs is still an unfortunate motto. A an important sub-group of these drugs are _psychedelics_. Psychedelics drugs have been used for centuries, potentially as long as they humans have existed in their modern form. The term psychedelic means "Mind manifastor" in most countries LSD and magic mushrooms are the most common substances being used. Nonetheless, it contains many more substances used by indigenous people all around the globe and even MDMA is considered to be psychedelic-like. 

All drugs (including alcohol) come with a tradeoff: desirable feelings against potential side-effects, such as addictivity or a hangover. Psychedelics on the other hand, have been shown in the last few years to have a third property: _healing_ and _self-development_. A new era of research has begun, showing the use of these drugs to effectively cure PTSD, addication to heroin and depression. Moreover, safe controlled usage could potentially lead to a boost in creativity, motivation, and a general sense of conntectedness with the world around us.

Finally, the usage of these drugs is somewhat commen among computer scientiest in the vally. It is only fair to openly speak about it.
