> ‚ÄúMaybe to be in a garden and feel awe, or wonder, in the presence of an astonishing mystery, is nothing more than a recovery of a misplaced perspective, perhaps the child‚Äôs-eye view; maybe we regain it by means of a neurochemical change that disables the filters (of convention, of ego) that prevent us in ordinary hours from seeing what is, like those lovely leaves, staring us in the face.‚Äù

A curated list of resources about the emerging renaissance of psychedelic drugs and their potential benefits.

## Intro 

Today, in the midst of the age of innovation, liberality, and new ideas, transparent education about (hard) drugs is still an unfortunate taboo. An important sub-group of these hard drugs are _psychedelics_. Psychedelics drugs have been used for centuries, potentially as long as they humans have existed in their modern form. The term psychedelic means "Mind manifestor‚Äù. In most regions of the world, LSD and magic mushrooms are the most common substances being used. Nonetheless, the psychedelics group contains many more substances used by indigenous people all around the globe and even MDMA is considered to be psychedelic-like. 

All drugs (including alcohol) come with a tradeoff: desirable feelings against potential side-effects, such as additivity or a hangover. Psychedelics on the other hand, have been shown in the last few years to have a third property: _healing_ and _self-development_ (combined with very little side-effects, such as almost no additivity). A new era of research has begun, showing the use of these drugs to effectively cure PTSD, addiction to heroin, depression and many other mental disorders. Moreover, safe controlled usage could potentially lead to a boost in creativity, motivation, and a general sense of connectedness with the world around us.

Finally, the usage of these drugs is somewhat common among computer scientist as well. It is only fair to openly speak about it openly.
